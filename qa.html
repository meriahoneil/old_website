    <h1>  Question & Answer </h1>
      <h3> Question #1: Why do you want to learn to code? </h3>
        <p>I want to learn how to code because I don't really know what the heck I'm doing with my life just yet and I'm still searching for something that really inspires me. From what limited exposure I've had to coding in the past few months, I'm thinking this might be it. And, I mean, if it's not at least I learned a practical skill that'll help me out in the future!</p>

      <h3> Question #2: What are you most excited about in South Africa? </h3>
        <p>I'm really excited for all the outdoorsy stuff; hiking Table mountain, visiting those pretty gardens I keep reading about, even cage diving (which I'm so deathly afraid of sharks so that should be interesting!). Also can't wait to feel all grown up drinking wine at a vineyard/winery or whatever it's called (clearly I'm quite the adult already).</p>
      <h3> Question #3: What's one surprising or cool thing about you that others might not know? </h3>
        <p> I only started doing yoga a few months ago so I'm not a pro but I can do a headstand and a few other cool poses.</p>
