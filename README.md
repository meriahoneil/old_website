## My Travel Blog
#### June 2, 2015

## Overview

#### Motivation

- What do I want to say with this page? What's its purpose? I want to discuss my life/travels.
- What's the target audience? Friends/family? Employers? Groupies? My target audience is friends and family as well as other lovers of travel.
- Is this a professional page, a portfolio? Just for fun, a design playground? This is a personal page meant to explore cool design layouts.

#### Content

- What do I want to actually put on it? 
- A photo or photo collage as a large central background photo along with a short introduction to the site's purpose/me.
- Blog style posts along with photographs from the trip and perhaps informative images from the internet (maps etc.)
- Links to things you've made (photos, videos, class projects)
- Links to how to contact you (FB, Github, etc.)

## Design

- What's the look and feel of it? Minimalist? Intricate? Goth? Minimalist
- You'll do a lot more of this when we start thinking about CSS.
- Will you use images? Icons? From where?
- Do some research! Look at other sites for inspiration.

## Code

You'll be using HTML and CSS, but as you think about your layout,
you might want to start thinking about logical sections of the page
(header, footer, sidebarâ€”if you want any of these things),
and how you might structure those with HTML.
